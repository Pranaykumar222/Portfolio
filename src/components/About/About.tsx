              Hello! I'm Pranay, a frontend developer and student at Apollo University, Andhra
              Pradesh. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites,
              applications, or anything in between.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              My interest in web development started back when I decided to try customizing a
              website theme â€” turns out hacking together a custom theme taught me a lot about
              HTML & CSS!
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building numerous web projects.
              My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
              experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              I'm currently looking for frontend development internship opportunities where I can
              apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer.
            </p>
